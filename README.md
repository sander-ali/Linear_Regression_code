# Linear_Regression_code

Linear Regression on Boston Housing Prices with and without available packages

This code implements linear regression with and without using Sklearn package.

The results show that the code without using any learning package can achieve almost the same RMSE as the builtin function from Sklearn.

Kindly install all the required packages before running the code such as Sklearn, seaborn. If you are running python without Anaconda then you also have to install matplotlib, numpy and pandas as well.

You can re-use, re-produce, and share this code as you like.
